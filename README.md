# defic - my shoddy attempt at cellular calculation software
## Naming
In an almost frightening stroke of genius, the author of this project decided to base its name on a niche spreadsheet software called [Microsoft Excel](https://www.libreoffice.org/discover/calc/), which apparently inherits its name from the latin word excellere (meaning to excel - i'm as shocked as you are). [The rest is left to the reader to figure out.](https://ancientlanguages.org/latin/dictionary/deficio-deficere-defeci-defectum)
## Inspiration
Blatantly taken from [Tsoding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCAgvKQDJng&t=3163s&pp=ygUNdHNvZGluZyBleGNlbA%3D%3D)
